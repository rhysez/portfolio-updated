            Welcome to my professional online portfolio. I'm a proficient JavaScript developer with a passion for
            building beautiful, responsive web applications. I'm creative in my approach, and determined to deliver
            software that is secure and scalable. However, my prime goal is being as good as I can at writing rock solid JavaScript.
