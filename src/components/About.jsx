            <span className='hello'>Hello!</span> As you could already tell, my name is Rhys, and I'm from Cornwall, United Kingdom. <br />
            I'm a proficient <span className="js">JavaScript</span> and{" "}
            <span className="react">React</span> developer with a passion for
            building beautiful, responsive web applications. 
            With a strong understanding of object oriented programming, I can
            build apps that are flexible and highly scalable. <br />
            When I'm not coding, I like to spend my spare time gaming or reading a book
            by the sea near my home town.
